-Performed Discriptive Analysis.
-Filled null values with respective the skweness and normally distributed values of the data with median and mean. 
-Histogram plotted for the data distrubution.
-Skweness corrected with the logarithmic function.
-Scatterplot created to understand the relationship between different variables.
-Pair plot also created to see the relationship between variables at once. 
-Performed the correlation Analysis with Pearsons Correlation.
- Spliting data into training and testing dataset.
- Different ML model implimented such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest classifier, XGBoost classifier, Gradient Boosting classifier, Support Vector Machine classifier, KNN classifier, Naive Bayes, XGBoost Random Forest Classifier.
-Classification report printed for model validation also checked the AUC-ROC for the model evaluation.
-Also, stacked ensemble technique used to show these model at once with the accuracy score by gridsearch CV.
